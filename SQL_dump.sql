Usually, the answer is that the decision requires us to spend scarce resources.

When you decide to spend your resource on something (e.g., investing into a research project, or accepting a delivery job), there is less of the resource that can be spent on something else. You thus have to think carefully about the tradeoffs involved in allocating resources to one objective as opposed to another. This class develops a quantitative framework for studying resource allocation problems. Resource allocation problems arise in many industries and areas such as transportation, electronics, advertising, finance, and health care. The specifics of each problem are very different.

Almost always we are\nlimited by some of the resources that we need to achieve our goals, and our decisions are about\nthe ?best? utilization of these resources in order to achieve our goals. Mathematical optimization\nis an area that offers tools and techniques to formulate precise mathematical models for our\ndecision problems. In this course, we are going to learn some of the basic types of models, a high\nlevel modeling language to encode our models in a computer interpretable way, and the use of\nprofessional optimization packages to solve our models in order to obtain the ?best? possible\ndecisions.\nThe course will introduce you to the basics of complexity theory and the analysis of algorithms,\ndynamic programming and shortest paths, greedy algorithms, matroids and polyhedral\ntechniques, network flows and related polyhedra, matching theory, stable matchings, knapsack\nproblems and approximation algorithms, cutting stock problems, set covering and\napproximations, cutting planes, Chvatal-Gomory cuts and lift-and-project methods.\nThe course is self-contained supported by weekly handouts. It is highly interactive, with some\nhomework assignments and two take home exams. We learn together modeling techniques,\nAMPL encoding, and the use of the solver packages via a series of examples. AMPL is a high\nlevel modeling language that allows us to formulate even complicated mathematical optimization\nmodels in an elegant and short way. The course utilizes full versions of top of the art solver\npackages, that are made available by AMPL Inc., in time limited course packets, which are\ndistributed via the course?s blackboard site.
